# Aids Prediction Using Machine Learning
# 🧬 Predicting AIDS Progression in People Living with HIV
---
## 📌 Project Domain

**Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)** is a virus that attacks the human immune system, specifically targeting **CD4 cells (T cells)** 🛡️, which are crucial in fighting off infections. If left untreated, HIV can progressively weaken the immune system and lead to **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)** ❌🧫 — a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition marked by severe immune deterioration and opportunistic infections.

📊 According to **UNAIDS (2023)**:
- 🌍 **39.9 million** people were living with HIV globally
- 💊 Only **9.3 million** had access to antiretroviral therapy (ART)
- ⚰️ **630,000 AIDS-related deaths**
- 🧪 **1.3 million new HIV infections**

In 🇮🇩 **Indonesia**, 2023 data reported:
- 🧾 **57,299 HIV cases** out of **6.14 million** people tested
- ➕ **17,121 newly identified AIDS cases**

⚠️ These numbers likely underrepresent the real situation due to underreporting, undiagnosed cases, and limited access to testing, especially in remote areas.

## Business Understanding ❔
## ❗ Problem Statements

The burden of HIV/AIDS remains a major global health challenge. A critical clinical need is to **identify high-risk individuals** living with HIV before they progress to AIDS.

### 🔍 Key Questions:
- 🤔 **How can we accurately predict whether an individual living with HIV is at risk of developing AIDS?**
- 🧠 **How can machine learning be utilized to assist early detection and prevent further transmission within the population?**

## 🎯 Goals

The main goal is to build a **reliable and interpretable machine learning model** 🤖 to support healthcare professionals in:
- 📈 Predicting AIDS progression in PLHIV (People Living with HIV)
- 🩺 Improving clinical decision-making and early intervention

### ✅ Specific Objectives:
- ⚙️ Train & evaluate ML models for AIDS prediction
- 🔍 Identify key predictive features
- 💡 Deliver actionable insights for healthcare providers

## 🛠️ Solution Statement

To solve the above challenges, we will implement the following steps:

### 1️⃣ Model Benchmarking (Baseline Models):
- 📉 **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- 🌲 **Random Forest (RF)**
- 🚀 **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**

### 2️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning:
- 🎯 Use **GridSearchCV** to optimize key model parameters

### 3️⃣ Evaluation Metrics:
We will assess each model using:

| Metric        | Description                                      | Emoji |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Accuracy**  | Correct predictions overall                      | ✅    |
| **Precision** | Correct AIDS predictions among predicted cases   | 🎯    |
| **Recall**    | Ability to detect true AIDS cases                | 🔍    |
| **F1-Score**  | Balance between precision & recall               | ⚖️    |
| **ROC-AUC**   | Class separation capability                      | 📈    |
